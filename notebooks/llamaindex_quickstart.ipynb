    "## LLamaIndex Introduction\n",
    "#### Context Augmentation\n",
    " - LLMs offer natural language interface for user. They are trained to complete your sentences.\n",
    " - They are not trained on your specific data requirements, they are trained on general data.\n",
    " - Your data may be far from the context that LLMs are trained on. For example, it might be behind APIs, SQL databases, PDFs etc.\n",
    " - To solve this problem, we can use context augmentation. Context Augmentation is a technique to add context to your LLM queries.\n",
    "\n",
    " - We can use context augmentation to make LLMs more robust and accurate. e.g. (Retrieval augmented Generation.)\n",
    "\n",
    " #### Agents\n",
    "  -  Agents are LLM-powered assistants equipped with additional capabilities, they can perform research, data extraction and more. (an LLM equipped with tool is an example)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflows\n",
    " - Workflows are a collection of agents that work together to solve a specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "These all can be made possible by using the LLamaIndex framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex uses alot of integrations (over 300+ integrations) to connect LLMs with various data sources and tools.\n",
    "The imports are mentioned with the following pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# typical pattern\n",
    "from llama_index.core.xxx import ClassABC  # core submodule xxx\n",
    "from llama_index.xxx.yyy import (\n",
    "    SubclassABC,\n",
    ")  # integration yyy for submodule xxx\n",
    "\n",
    "# concrete example\n",
    "from llama_index.core.llms import LLM\n",
    "from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI\n",
